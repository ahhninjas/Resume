### <u><b><center>Experience</b></u>
<b><u><center>Web Developer</u><br>
<u>[Universal Bit Project]()</u><br>
May 2017 –  November 2018<br>
[San Marcos, Texas]()<br>
<center><b>[Uni-Wallet](), [Unibit.io]()</b></center>
<ul>
- Helped create UniBit, which is hosted on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) with multiple nodes currently deployed.<br>
- I helped write the white paper detailing the functions of UniBIT amongst other documentation designed to reach  public view.<br>
- The UniBIT Multichain platform allows for new cryptocurrency token creation within the Uni-Wallet.<br>
- The platform serves as a digital holding company for applications that developers build upon the platform using UniBIT as a form of exchange.<br>
- Solidified business contacts that were currently forming their own cryptocurrencies for their own unique blockchain applications. Met with venture capitalists, and attended investor meetings showcasing blockchain applications in order to create contacts within the space. Gave presentations and plugged the UniBIT and Scout.click software applications.<br>

<div>
<b><center><u>[Scout.Click](http://scout.click/)</b></center>
<center>![](/)</center><br>
- This application is designed to be a totally anonymous search engine that has the ability to search the real time Clearnet and a complete blockchain repository of the entire web.<br>
- UniBIT nodes provide a support network for the Scout.Click Inter Planetary File Sharing (IPFS) network, which is designed to compile and share a complete index of the web that includes both Clearnet https:// and Darkweb .onion addresses. Users can like and share websites in exchange for UniBITs. This provides a token incentive and gamification method to enhance the community value of the UniBIT token.<br>
- The IPFS network functions similar to torrents in that it distributes small encrypted packets of data within the network swarm, and it takes all of that data in whole from multiple users in the swarm to reassemble the data in to whatever item was being transferred over the network.<br>
- IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other not to tamper with data in transit.<br>

<div>
<b><u><center>[Cryptit.io](Cryptit.io)</b></u></center><br>
<center>![]()</center><br>
- Web application that was designed to encrypt and decrypt files using SHA-256 encryption. SHA-256 is a crack able encryption protocol, but only via quantum computing, or ASIC/GPU cracking techniques.<br>
- Users are able to privately send communications, documentation, and media around the world via email with an encrypted password required to access it.<br>
I coded the GitPitch presentation in GitHub Markdown language via GitHub and Atom, and created the initial graphics for the website.

Hackathon Participation<br>
Factom Hackathon<br>
Participant<br>
Solution: Use of blockchain to improve shipping, tracking, verification, and identification of products via a paperless system.<br>
Application Name: PeachesAhead<br>
Jul 2018<br>
Capital Factory, Austin, Texas<br>
Developed a paperless verification application for the distribution of peaches, or any product. Users can scan a Quick Response (QR) code at a Point of Sale (POS), or on the production line, to display data tagged to any specified unit. This ensures that units in the database are authentic, and can be sorted according to any tags, or analytics paired with each unit in the database.

Web Developer and Groundskeeper<br>
[Space Lab Maker's Space](Spacelab.io)<br>
May – Dec 2017<br>
New Braunfels, TX<br>
This was an experiment in creating a scalable business where anyone with UniBIT's, or BitCoins could utilize the space and tools therein to create things.<br>
Participants would use AutoCad/Corel Draw to write the G-Code (RS-274) required to operate the machinery properly.<br>
Facility specifically focused on CNC (Computer Numerical Control), lazer etching, milling, lathing, and 3D printing.<br>
The space also served as a forum for weekly BitCoin meetups to add new members, software developers, potential investors, and partnerships.<br>
The idea has been spearheaded by Mutuwell Inc, and PresciousPlastic whom are both partnerships of UniBit Labs LLC.<br>
